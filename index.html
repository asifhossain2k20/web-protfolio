    <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>

        <h2>My Dream</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, learning how to design webpages using drag-and-drop and static HTML pages is no longer enough. To be competitive today, students need to know the foundation of HTML, but they also need to be fluent in a server-side language such as PHP. The problem is the old methods and tools do not work well when trying to prepare students for the real world, or teach them PHP.
